Problem Statements
Q1) Beginning with an empty binary search tree. Construct the binary search tree by
inserting the values in given order. After constructing binary search tree perform
following operations 1) Insert a new node 2) Find numbers of node in longest
path 3) Minimum and maximum data value found in tree 4) Change a tree so that
the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node 5)Search an
element
Q2) Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary tree by inserting the values
in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations
on it a)Perform inorder, preorder and post order traversal b) Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at
every node c) Find the height of tree d) Copy this tree to another [operator=] e) Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes. f) Erase all nodes in a binary tree.
